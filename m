Thanks for the reminder about the original discussion. You have a better
memory than I do ;-)

Could others (at least Richard, Nico ?) share their opinion here?
Otherwise it's hard to find a majority opinion...

The question is whether we should use em dashes
(https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/em-dash.html), described as "---"
in Restructed Text. This respects the English punctuation rules, but is
harder to grep in the sources.

If we prefer to use hyphens instead of em dashes in the documentation,
we will have to document the exception, but the risk remains to get
questions from time to time.

My vote goes to using em dashes, and I submitted patches for the YP and
Bitbake docs, but of course, I can accept the opposite choice if there's
a majority for it.

Thanks in advance
Cheers
Michael.
