Yes, I think I'd like to port these simplifications to yocto-docs soon afte=

while memory is still fresh

We use it in doc/conf.py:

current_version =3D 'dev'

with open("bitbake.yaml") as data:
    buff =3D data.read()
    subst_vars =3D yaml.safe_load(buff)
    current_version =3D subst_vars["DOCCONF_VERSION"]

So basically we just need a way to pass this information from set_versions.=
py to
the sphinx-build command.

So basically, you'd write a variables.py file from set_versions.py and read=
 it
from conf.py?

I'm starting to wonder if it just wouldn't be better do move all of this lo=
gic
into doc/conf.py, actually.

Thanks,
Antonin
