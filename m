Greetings,

Looking at the code, it seems that the DEFAULT_PREFERENCE variable is no
longer in use. Unless I missed something, the variable is still read,
but not taken into account any more, and there are just two recipes that
set it.

The BitBake documentation still refers to it though.

May I propose documentation and code patches to remove it for good?

Cheers
Michael.
