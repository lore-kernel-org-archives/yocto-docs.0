I found your script from patch messages
(http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky-contrib/commit/?h=rpurdie/overrides-convert&id=f7c5c3bbb9bc5d4c4c8f798d64a020a4504542df),
and it seems to do the job fine. I just had to exclude the migration
guides, but that's easy to do it manually.

How shall I proceed? Shall I send a big patch to
docs@lists.yoctoproject.org for people to review and check that the
output from your script is right?

Thanks in advance
Michael.
