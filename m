Whole BACKFILL mechanism was added for easier backwards compatibility with
existing DISTROs.

Renaming the variable breaks those DISTROs and personally I don't find the
new variables less confusing than the old ones.

I've always read it as: These are the DISTRO_FEATURES which will be
automatically BACKFILLED if you don't do anything and if you notice the
change and CONSIDER them as not wanted, you opt-out by adding them to
BACKFILL_CONSIDERED.

Yes it's confusing, but this whole mechanism wasn't used much, so I'm
surprised a bit that people still have to deal with it.

IIRC BACKFILL mechanism predates :remove operator by quite a bit.

So BACKFILL wa added as very weak sort-of-append to DISTRO_FEATURES and
BACKFILL_CONSIDERED was to opt-out from it.
