openssl has been using these environment variables for decades. I can
understand that they hesitate to change any of that. Also because some
of the code is obviously trying to avoid any posix dependencies including
stat().

https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/19242

"t8m commented 15 days ago
I am afraid this is potentially asking for security issues. It would
have to be implemented very carefully."

"beldmit commented 15 days ago
I don't like this approach as a whole. IMHO, we should have some defines
to find installation-specific values for a specific installation."

"levitte commented 14 days ago
It's possible that it would be better if util/wrap.pl became a public
tool. Not necessarily exactly as it works now, but something with a
similar intent."

"levitte commented 14 days ago
This isn't just an OpenSSL problem, is it? There are other libraries
that are plugable (and essentially, providers are exactly that,
plugins), and I imagine that they also have their own custom default
location for plugins.
Otherwise, the obvious answer would be that you should install things
that belong with OpenSSL into its default locations... and that's
answered with openssl version -a as said above, or with the openssl info
command in later OpenSSL versions."

So wrapper it is then.

Exactly.

Well, the openssl-native recipes 'openssl' wrapper script seems to be fine.

This openssl-native.bbclass extends the same approach for those who just load
the shared libraries. python3-cryptography-native would be one clear
user since currently it's completely broken and even fails to load the
python3 module.
