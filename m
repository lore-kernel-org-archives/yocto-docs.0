Greetings,

I copied the OE-core mailing list to get the attention of contributors. 
If you want your new features to be featured in the release and 
migration notes for 4.2, it's time to speak!

What I wrote so far is a very early draft meant to help you detect 
what's missing and correct what I've written so far.

See my questions and comments below...

Any more Rust changes we should mention in the migration notes?

Here in the release notes, I didn't work on the detailed changes, such 
as version changes for the kernel and many recipes. I'm trying to help 
with the first part showing the big picture.

More BitBake changes we should mention?

By the way, what's the status of Y2038 support in Mickledore? Are all 
tests passing now?

To make the drafts easier to review, they have been compiled in the 
master-next branch:

Thanks in advance
