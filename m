Good point. So there's two directions this could take (if we want that feat=
ure):

- Make this option change the behavior of warnings, and make them _act_ (no=
t
  just look) like errors, so a given task would stop in case of warning.

- Rename the option and make it clearer: warnings are still warnings but th=
e
  return code will be 1 if there are any.

  Maybe "-W,--fail-on-warnings: Make bitbake return 1 if any warning is
  emitted"?

I feel like the second option might be best as the first one is changing th=
e
behavior of tasks and I also think this might not be desirable.

With the second option it allows having a positive exit code on warnings wh=
ile
still being able to have a look at all of them (not only the single one tha=
t
stopped the build as would happen with the first option), just as you would=
 with
a normal bitbake execution.
