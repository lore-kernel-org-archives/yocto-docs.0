From: Simone Wei=C3=9F <simone.p.weiss@posteo.com>

This is inspired by the same section in the yocto-docs. It aims to provid=
e
information in what contexts(recipes, .conf, bbclass,...) a variable is u=
sually
used. For that I tried to group similar variables, so that a short overvi=
ew is
given. This was inspired by [YOCTO #14072], but of course does not implem=
ent a
warning if a variable is used in an unintended context.

Notes to v3:=20
- Applied the fixes suggested in review (thanks for the patch! I hope add=
ing the
  Signed-off like this during squashing is fine)
- For the ref label, I plan to come up with an svg that illustrates tasks=
,
  recipes, classes, conf (thanks Quentin for the suggestion), but in a ge=
neric
  way and add it to the Concepts section, I want to add a ref from there.

+Variables might only have an impact or can be used in certain contexts. =
Some
+should only be used in global files like ``.conf``, while others are int=
ended only
+for local files like ``.bb``. This chapter aims to describe some importa=
nt variable
+contexts.

+Variables starting with ``BB_`` usually configure the behaviour of BitBa=
ke itself.
+For example, one could configure:
+
+- System resources, like disk space to be used (:term:`BB_DISKMON_DIRS`)=
,
+  or the number of tasks to be run in parallel by BitBake (:term:`BB_NUM=
BER_THREADS`).
+
+- How the fetchers shall behave, e.g., :term:`BB_FETCH_PREMIRRORONLY` is=
 used
+  by BitBake to determine if BitBake's fetcher shall search only
+  :term:`PREMIRRORS` for files.
+
+Those variables are usually configured globally.

+
+There are variables:
+
+- Like :term:`B` or :term:`T`, that are used to specify directories used=
 by
+  BitBake during the build of a particular recipe. Those variables are
+  specified in ``bitbake.conf``. Some, like :term:`B`, are quite often
+  overwritten in recipes.
+
+- Starting with ``FAKEROOT``, to configure how the ``fakeroot`` command =
is
+  handled. Those are usually set by ``bitbake.conf`` and might get adapt=
ed in a
+  ``bbclass``.
+
+- Detailing where BitBake will store and fetch information from, for
+  data reuse between build runs like :term:`CACHE`, :term:`DL_DIR` or
+  :term:`PERSISTENT_DIR`. Those are usually global.
+
+
+Layers and files
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+Variables starting with ``LAYER`` configure how BitBake handles layers.
+Additionally, variables starting with ``BB`` configure how layers and fi=
les are
+handled. For example:
+
+- :term:`LAYERDEPENDS` is used to configure on which layers a given laye=
r
+  depends.
+
+- The configured layers are contained in :term:`BBLAYERS` and files in
+  :term:`BBFILES`.
+
+Those variables are often used in the files ``layer.conf`` and ``bblayer=
s.conf``.
+
+Recipes and packages
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+Variables handling recipes and packages can be split into:
+
+- :term:`PN`, :term:`PV` or :term:`PF` for example, contain information =
about
+  the name or revision of a recipe or package. Usually, the default set =
in
+  ``bitbake.conf`` is used, but those are from time to time overwritten =
in
+  recipes.
+
+- :term:`SUMMARY`, :term:`DESCRIPTION`, :term:`LICENSE` or :term:`HOMEPA=
GE`
+  contain the expected information and should be set specifically for ev=
ery
+  recipe.
+
+- In recipes, variables are also used to control build and runtime
+  dependencies between recipes/packages with other recipes/packages. The
+  most common should be: :term:`PROVIDES`, :term:`RPROVIDES`, :term:`DEP=
ENDS`,
+  and :term:`RDEPENDS`.
+
+- There are further variables starting with ``SRC`` that specify the sou=
rces in
+  a recipe like :term:`SRC_URI` or :term:`SRCDATE`. Those are also usual=
ly set
+  in recipes.
+
+- Which version or=C2=A0provider of a recipe should be given preference =
when
+  multiple recipes would provide the same item, is controlled by variabl=
es
+  starting with ``PREFERRED_``. Those are normally set in the configurat=
ion
+  files of a ``MACHINE`` or ``DISTRO``.
