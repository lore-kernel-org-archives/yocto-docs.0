From: Quentin Schulz <quentin.schulz@cherry.de>

The recipe name matching wasn't fully explained and were missing a few
important corner cases such as recipes without a version, or using the %
character outside of the version part of the filename for example.

This adds the last missing bits to cover every append naming scenario
that exist today.

This was derived from lib/bb/cooker.py:get_file_appends().

 In the most general case, you could name the append file something as

+The "``%``" character is a marker for BitBake, and everything after that marker
+will not be used for matching recipe names. That is, an append file named::
+
+   busybox_1.%.11.bbappend
+
+will match recipes named::
+
+   busybox_1.0.11.bb
+   busybox_1.2.bb
+   busybox_1.3.48.bb

+Note that the "``%``" character is not specific to the version part of the
+recipe name. That is, an append file named::
+
+   linux-yocto%.bbappend
+
+will match recipes named::

+   linux-yocto.bb

+   linux-yocto-tiny_6.12.bb
+   linux-yocto-rt_6.16.bb
+
+While it can be useful to append to similar recipes with slightly different
+names, it is highly discouraged to do so as recipes from other layers may be
+named similarly enough that the append file would unwittingly match them.
+
+A recipe named without a version may only be appended by an append file named
+exactly the same. That is, a recipe named::
+
+   mesa.bb
+
+can only be appended by an append file named::
+
+   mesa.bbappend
+
+That is, ``mesa_%.bbappend`` append file will not match a ``mesa.bb`` recipe.
