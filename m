Not quite: this holds the specific configuration.

It embeds the generic configuration and adds information about the
choices made during the initialization.
It is also a git repository, that contains a history of the specific
configuration and updates made to it via 'bitbake-setup update'.
(this should probably go to the terminology section)

One or more Setup directories, each of them containing a Setup.

There's no one to one mapping anymore, that's from an obsolete earlier
prototype which did not have the 'choose from options' approach.

Better:

It is constructed from a Generic configuration via choices made during...

config/ holds a Specific configuration under git-backed version
control. (and see above)

It is also possible to specify the choices on the command line for a
completely non-interactivie initialization.

A definition for the Specific configuration should be added here perhaps?

That structure is not enforced at all. Bitbake-setup will do a
complete file tree walk and take anything that ends in .conf.json, so
the directory structure is freeform and up to the registry maintainer.

--setup-dir, not required if the command is invoked from an
initialized bitbake environment that contains BBPATH.

Erroneous copy-paste?

Also add:

The purpose of buildtools tarball is to provide tools needed to run
bitbake on build machines where such tools cannot be easily obtained
from the host Linux distribution (for example on older distrubution
versions that do not contain a recent enough gcc compiler or python
interpreter, or machines where the user running bitbake cannot easily
install additional software into the system). This command requires
that Openembedded-core layer is present in a configuration. Please see

Probably mention that this is done with the --setting option?

This is most useful on systems where the default location of
~/bitbake-builds is not suitable, and there is a dedicated directory
for yocto builds somewhere else.

This is the location for the download cache that bitbake-setup will
configure for the purpose of downloading configuration repositories
and layers using bitbake fetchers. Please see 'link to
user-manual-fetching', 'link to ref-variables-DL-DIR' for further
information. The location can be set such that it is shared with
DL_DIR specified by bitbake builds, so that there is a single
directory containing a copy of everything needed to set up and run a
bitbake build offline in a reproducible manner.

If the value is matching the branch name, bitbake-setup will check out
the latest revion on that branch, and keep it updated when using the
'update' sub-command.

The purpose of such nesting is to be able to scale the configurations,
for example when there is a need to create multiple configurations
that share some parameters (which are specified in their common
parent), but differ between themselves in other parameters.
Bitbake-setup will assemble configuration choices by putting together
information from a leaf configuration and all of its ancestors.

Yay, the work to document fragments paid off here :)

Probably this instead should refer to the definition in terminology above?

Otherwise, fantastic work!
