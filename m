Hi Fawzi

Many thanks for this patch too. Much appreciated!

Good catch finding this outdated part of the BitBake manual.

See my comments below...

Wait, before this, it seems you forgot to update the output of the 
"bitbake" command right after setting the BBPATH variable. Or maybe you 
didn't work with the "master" branch. Here's what I get when I use 
bitbake from the current Poky master branch:

$bitbake
Nothing to do.  Use 'bitbake world' to build everything, or run 'bitbake 
--help' for usage information.

Unless there's something in my environment that makes BitBake behave 
differently, but that's worth double checking anyway.

Same here. At this stage on Poky master, I get:
$bitbake
Nothing to do.  Use 'bitbake world' to build everything, or run 'bitbake 
--help' for usage information.

Good catch. This is ugly in the current docs.

You may mention that "dunfell" is just an example, and should be adapted 
to the OpenEmbedded-Core version(s) that your layer supports. By the 
way, "kirkstone" should be a better choice as it should last longer than 
"dunfell".

By the way, wishing we had a DISTRO_NAME_NO_CAP macro like in the YP 
manual, but that's will be a separate topic.

Before this too, I don't have the same output when I run "bitbake 
printhello" for the first time:

Weird, I believe I followed the instructions correctly, but I still have:
ERROR: Nothing PROVIDES 'printhello'

This will probably help to know which version of Bitbake you're using. 
For documentation in "master", you should be using "master" too.

Sorry for all this changes, but it's great to fix an outdated version. 
If you lack time, I'll be happy to suggest a V2 that you could review 
then. Let me know...

Thanks again
Michael.
