I think we agreed on naming those:

BitBake Setup Configuration Template
BitBake Setup Configuration Instance

?

Once again, I think it's important that those two terms refer to the JSON f=
iles.
I think adding "configuration" makes it clearer, especially for the "instan=
ce".

Also not sure about prefixing it with "Bitbake Setup". In your book you can
always prefix "Configuration Template/Instance" with "Bitbake Setup", but I
think in this document it clear that's it's related to bitbake-setup.
