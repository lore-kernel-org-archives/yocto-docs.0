From: Quentin Schulz <quentin.schulz@cherry.de>

The recipe name matching wasn't fully explained and were missing a few
important corner cases such as recipes without a version, or using the %
character outside of the version part of the filename for example.

This adds the last missing bits to cover every append naming scenario
that exist today.

This was derived from lib/bb/cooker.py:get_file_appends().

 In the most general case, you could name the append file something as
