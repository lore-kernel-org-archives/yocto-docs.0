Ross (copied here) was talking about it on IRC[1]. Hard to say which way or=
 the
other was desired from this conversation though. It did give me the idea to
contribute this feature as I also need it sometimes.

I personally have seen multiple projects where builds started in CI environ=
ments
needed to stop when warnings are emitted. I'm happy to keep my scripts as t=
hey
are but I thought this series would make things a bit easier for users.

I cannot say which solution for it the userbase would prefer though!
