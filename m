This goes against previous efforts to convert the documentation and other
components to not use these words :/

I had the impression, from the documentation, that bitbake-setup would leav=
e the
repository in the middle of a rebase, to let you deal with conflict, and th=
en
continue on the next bitbake-setup update call.

It appears to use --abort instead, so a misunderstanding from my part.

Out of these options, I think "reset" might be the best one, I agree with
Quentin. But I'm not a native speaker, so I might not have an understanding=
 as
subtle as others.

I'll let Richard decide on what to do here.
