Dear OE-core contributors,

I've reviewed all the commits specific to the Nanbield branch and came 
up with this draft or the release and migration notes for this upcoming 
release:

  * https://docs.yoctoproject.org/next/migration-guides/migration-4.3.html
  * https://docs.yoctoproject.org/next/migration-guides/release-notes-4.3.html

If you made a contribution that is featured in the new release, it would 
be great if you could check whether it's advertised in the release notes 
with sufficient detail. I'm pretty sure some noteworthy changes didn't 
catch my attention.

In particular, I'm pretty sure that the runqemu changes should be 
properly summarized, as well at the CVE management ones.

This way, new users will be aware of your new feature(s)!

Of course, I'm also interested in reviews of the text. Some sections are 
still empty, but some of them will be filled by our usual scripts when 
the release is ready. Some of them are also empty because I haven't 
found any noteworthy changes yet. The latter will be removed if they 
should indeed be empty.

And don't hesitate to send patches against the yocto-docs "master-next" 
branch!
Thanks in advance
Cheers
Michael.
