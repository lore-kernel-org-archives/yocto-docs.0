I've just tested this so far, and I have the same output as you do.

However, when I run "bitbake" again after setting BBPATH (step 4), I get 
an error message that is not mentioned in the patch (which doesn't 
update step 4):

ERROR: Unable to parse 
/home/mike/work/git/git.openembedded.org/bitbake/lib/bb/parse/__init__.py

              fn = newfn
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] file conf/bitbake.conf not found in 
/home/mike/tmp/hello

I confirm I'm using the latest bitbake.

Now, I'm getting something different. Maybe I wasn´t referring to the 
right step (step 6 here). I have the same error but with extra details:

ERROR: Unable to parse 
/home/mike/work/git/git.openembedded.org/bitbake/lib/bb/parse/parse_py/BBHandler.py

     >            raise ParseError("Could not inherit file %s" % (file), 
fn, lineno)

bb.parse.ParseError: ParseError in configuration INHERITs: Could not 
inherit file classes/base.bbclass

I think at least there should be a "..." line to indicate that there are 
more lines between the bitbake command and the final line. Unless I'm 
the only one getting this.

This should still be addressed.

Fawzi, could you send an update addressing at least the above remarks?

Then, I'll be happy to test your new instructions again.

Thanks again,

Cheers
Michael.
