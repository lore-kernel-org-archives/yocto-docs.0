Hi Adrian

Thanks for the new code and the corresponding documentation. See my 
comments below... (also copying the "docs" mailing list).

I would use ``local.conf`` here.

Also, there's a simpler solution to get a code block here:

... to the ``local.conf``file::

Same here.

Since you are talking about the cmake class:

s/``cmake``/the :ref:`ref-classes-cmake` class/

Anyway, I find that the sentence doesn't fit well with the following items.

What about

"Here is it does for a recipe which inherits the 
:ref:`ref-classes-cmake` class:"?

You are here repeating the same sentence as a few lines above. Are you 
sure you meant to do that?

Good luck for the edits!
Could you let me know when the code changes made it to the master 
branch? This way I know I can merge the documentation too.

Thanks again for your work.
Cheers
Michael.
