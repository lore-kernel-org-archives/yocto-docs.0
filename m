Greetings,

I'm trying to update the documentation in
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/overview-manual/concepts.html#checksums-signatures.
With OEEquivHash, meta/lib/oe/sstatesig.py now implements 3 signature
handlers instead of 2.

However, I find parts of this document difficult to understand. In
particular, what's OEBasic supposed to do?
I could clarify its description if I could understand it better. We just
know that it doesn't store the task hash into the task stamp, but what else?

Sorry, I looked at the code, but it is not explicit enough (at least for
me) to find the answers by myself.

By the way, this "Checksums (Signatures)" chapter looks like an exact
duplicate of what is found in BitBake's manual
(https://docs.yoctoproject.org/bitbake/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual-execution.html).
This is bad because future changes could introduce discrepancies between
both copies and confuse readers. Shouldn't we have a summary in the
Yocto docs instead and refer to BitBake's manual instead? Or the
opposite, as OEBasic, OEBasicHash and OEEquivHash are implemented by
OE-Core and are a nice illustration of what BitBake allows to do?

Thanks in advance for your help and advice.
Cheers
Michael.
