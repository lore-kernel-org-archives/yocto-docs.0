I was going to write a reply to some of that, I still might, but as I
was doing it, another idea did just come to mind.

Somewhere I'm guessing openssl has some common init function?

Perhaps in that we patch in a hook, which looks at the current path of
the library, compares that to the default install location, then sets
the magic envvars accordingly if the location has changed?

That code should be isolatable in that we only have one entry point to
patch in and as you say, the envvars have been around forever, we'd
just need to watch for new ones.

The advantage to this is that the openssl library should then "just
work", we don't need to worry about the environment being present
everywhere?

This would also give us a new way to avoid some of these kinds of
issues with a new example to follow which doesn't involve manually
ensuring all users are tweaked. I really don't like the environment
variable approach for libraries.

Cheers,

Richard
