I'll add my configuration here, maybe someone or myself can add some doc fo=
r it
later, here or elsewhere.

configuration I use:

[b4]
  pw-url =3D https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/
  pw-key =3D <redacted>
  pw-project =3D docs
  pw-review-state =3D under-review
  pw-accept-state =3D accepted
  pw-discard-state =3D rejected

For `pw-project`, it comes from the project name on patchwork, e.g.:

  https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/project/docs/list
                                             ^^^^

The pw-key can be obtained from the user's personal settings.

Then `b4 {am,shazam}` will automatically set the state to under-review.

`b4 ty -d` will reject the patch. Sometimes I use `b4 ty --pw-set-state
superseded -d ...` when I know another version of the patch/series was sent=
.

Finally `b4 ty -a` will also set the accepted state along the generation of
thank-you file.

And overall it's much easier than clicking buttons on patchwork :)

Thanks for the script Quentin!

I was thinking, for eocore we could even extend the list of cc from
meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc.
