At the moment, the section on explaining DEFAULT_PREFERENCE uses an
example of busybox, which does not even use this feature anymore.
Replace this with an example using "nginx", which does.

+   It is not uncommon for a given recipe to provide more than one
+   version -- a stable (and preferred) version that should be selected
+   by default, and a newer, development or "bleeding edge" version that
+   will be selected only explicitly by the developer.
+
+   For example, at the moment, in the OpenEmbedded codebase, there are
+   two versions of the ``nginx`` webserver: a stable "1.28.0" version
+   that would be selected by default, and a newer "1.29.1" development
+   version that a developer would need to choose explicitly.
+
+   This can be seen based on this snippet from the ``nginx`` 1.29.1
+   recipe file::
+
+      # 1.28.x branch is the current stable branch, the recommended default
+      # 1.29.x is the current mainline branches containing all new features
+      DEFAULT_PREFERENCE = "-1"
