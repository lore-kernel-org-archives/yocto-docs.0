Since nobody except Quentin voted against this change (for practical 
reasons to grep in the source code), I'll like to proceed with this 
change, to be consistent with standard rules for English text.

At least, this will allow us to distinguish simple dashes and em dashes, 
which have a different meaning, and may help Sphinx to break lines (or 
not to) in a correct way.

Cheers
Michael.
