Greetings,

I'd need clarification about this section in Poky's
meta-poky/conf/local.conf.sample file:

# Yocto Project SState Mirror
#
# The Yocto Project has prebuilt artefacts available for its releases,
you can enable
# use of these by uncommenting the following lines. This will mean the
build uses
# the network to check for artefacts at the start of builds, which does
slow it down
# equally, it will also speed up the builds by not having to build
things if they are
# present in the cache. It assumes you can download something faster
than you can build it
# which will depend on your network.
# Note: For this to work you also need hash-equivalence passthrough to
the matching server
#
#BB_HASHSERVE_UPSTREAM = "typhoon.yocto.io:8687"
#SSTATE_MIRRORS ?= "file://.*
http://sstate.yoctoproject.org/3.4/PATH;downloadfilename=PATH"

How to set enable "hash-equivalence passthrough"?
I haven't managed to find details in the source code yet...

Thanks in advance
Michael.
