Robert reported being confused by the leading slash inconsistencies in
our BBMASK examples and wondered if it had any significance. Myself not
being less confused, I went reading the code and testing, and it does
have significance, so this tries to explain the difference and why you
would want a leading slash in most cases.

It also explains that still with only a leading slash there could be
involuntary matches, which one should be able to get rid of by using
BBFILE_PATTERN from the layer they want to mask recipe or append files
from.

While at it, update the meta-ti example such that it matches what's
currently in the repo (migrated in kirkstone from a single meta-ti git
repo layer to a meta-ti git repo with multiple layers, such as
meta-ti-bsp).

This reorganizes examples such that the ones with BBFILE_PATTERN are the
ones we provide as first examples as those are the ones users should
typically be using such that the masks only apply to a specific layer.

Changes in v3:
- switched to a list to explain the multiple matching rules for the
  example with multiple BBMASK such that it's easier to digest,
- added missing words here and there,
- reworded the openldap explanation to make it clear it matches
  everything under an openldap directory,
- added missing naming scheme for optee file match rule,
- switched absolute paths from /builds/ to /bitbake-builds/poky-master/
  such that it matches the layout when using bitbake-setup,
- Link to v2: https://patch.msgid.link/20260216-bbmask-slashes-v2-0-b9bb52f5fd3d@cherry.de

Changes in v2:
- added patch 5,
- completely reorganize patch 3 such that the examples with
  BBFILE_PATTERN are the ones provided by default,
- Link to v1: https://patch.msgid.link/20260211-bbmask-slashes-v1-0-b72161c647ef@cherry.de
