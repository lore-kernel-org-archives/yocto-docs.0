Would it also possible to mention what was wrong in the previous 
description?
The fact that the assignment is made at the end of the parsing process, 
which isn't correct given the example that you give? Otherwise, A := 
"${W}" wouldn't work, right?

Shouldn't we say "via any of the other assignment operators" instead?
It would sound a little better to me.

Thanks again
