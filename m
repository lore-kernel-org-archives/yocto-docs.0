I think the new description is missing some of the information of the=20
original description, e.g., "when multiple "??=3D" assignments exist, the=20
last one is used". So, e.g.:

W ??=3D "x"
W ??=3D "y"

gives

W =3D "y"

Another interesting case that is easy to get wrong is:

W ??=3D "x"
W +=3D "y"

that gives

W =3D " y"
=09
and which should be compared to

W ??=3D "x"
W:append =3D " y"

that gives

W =3D "x y"
