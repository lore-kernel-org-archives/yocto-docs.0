Hi Simone,

Thanks a lot for the new document. It looks super useful!

Oops, you should generate this patch from the bitbake source repository, 
not from Poky. I managed to tweak your patch so that it applies, but you 
don't want to add extra work on RP's shoulders.

For the prefix of variable names, I'd use double quotes through out the 
document (here ``BB_``), as you did for "PREFERRED_" at the end by the 
way ;)
This looks more natural to me.

s/number of tasks/the number of tasks/


Another thing is that we usually capitalize the list items, so here it 
would be "- System resources" instead. Could you change this everywhere 
in your patch?

I would improve this line by writing:

- starting with ``FAKEROOT``, to configure how the ``fakeroot`` command 
is handled.

This may be more explicit.

Weird, I don't see the new document in the left menu bar after the 
variable index.

IMHO, it would make more sense to have this right after the 
"bitbake-user-manual-metadata" document, because it would be too late 
after the variable index.
You'll also have to change the header settings (title with "===" instead 
of "***").

Thanks in advance for the V2. There's not so much to change :}
Cheers
Michael.
