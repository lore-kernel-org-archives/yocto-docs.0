All things considered, since scripts/create-pull-request is still in 
use, in particular by Steve and Bruce, I'm leaning towards documenting 
both variants:

  * Creating a simple pull request using the standard git tools, as
    several of us are doing. Richard doesn't seem to mind. At least in
    my case, this applies to changes I previously submitted through the
    lists.
  * Creating a more elaborate pull request from a branch containing
    commits that haven't been shared yet, typically like what Steve
    does. This way, people can review each patch individually by e-mail.

Unless we want to standardize our pull requests, and make sure each 
commit is submitted (sometimes once again) as a separate patch. In that 
case, we'd only document the use of scripts/create-pull-request.

Cheers
Michael.
