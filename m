From: Quentin Schulz <quentin.schulz@cherry.de>

The documentation doesn't explain the side-effect of putting a leading
slash, only the trailing slash.

The leading slash is not for making the regular expression match an
absolute path, but to force the match on the directory or file that
exactly starts (and ends if there is a trailing slash) with the
specified string. So let's explain that.

This also explains that this doesn't prevent more than the intended path
to be caught, specifically because it is NOT a regular expression
matching an absolute path.

Because any pattern not starting with a ^ character can match multiple
directories from multiple directories, let's make the usage of
BBFILE_PATTERN_my-layer the recommended one. Keep the rest as hints at
what can happen when not using but reiterate what users should be using.

       The following example uses a complete regular expression to tell
       BitBake to ignore all recipe and recipe append files in
-      ``meta-ti/recipes-misc/`` directories (and their subdirectories)::
+      ``recipes-bsp`` directory (recursively) of ``meta-ti``::
 
-         BBMASK = "/meta-ti/recipes-misc/"
+         BBMASK = "${BBFILE_PATTERN_meta-ti}/recipes-bsp/"
 
       If you want to mask out multiple directories or recipes, you can
       specify multiple regular expression fragments. This next example
       masks out multiple directories and individual recipes::
 
-         BBMASK += "/meta-ti/recipes-ti/packagegroup/"
-         BBMASK += "/meta-oe/recipes-support/"
-         BBMASK += "/meta-foo/.*/openldap"
-         BBMASK += "opencv.*\.bbappend"
-         BBMASK += "lzma"
+         BBMASK += "${BBFILE_PATTERN_meta-ti}/recipes-graphics/libgal/"
+         BBMASK += "${BBFILE_PATTERN_openembedded-layer}/recipes-support/"
+         BBMASK += "${BBFILE_PATTERN_openembedded-layer}/.*/openldap"
+         BBMASK += "${BBFILE_PATTERN_meta-ti}/.*/optee.*\.bbappend"
+
+      This masks the ``recipes-graphics/libgal/`` from ``meta-ti``, everything
+      under ``recipes-support`` in ``meta-oe``, every directory or file whose
+      name starts with ``openldap`` in ``meta-oe`` at any directory depth > 1
+      (e.g. in ``meta-oe``, ``recipes-foo/openldap-stuff/`` or
+      ``recipes-bar/baz/openldap_0.1.bb`` but not ``openldap/``), every append
+      file in ``meta-ti`` at any directory depth > 1 (e.g.
+      ``optee/optee-examples_%.bbappend`` and
+      ``recipes-security/optee/optee-client_%.bbappend``).
 
       .. note::
 
-         When specifying a directory name, use the trailing slash character
-         to ensure you match just that directory name.
+         Because these are complete regular expressions, if you want to match a
+         directory and not a file, you must end the expression with a trailing
+         slash. That is::
+
+            BBMASK += "${BBFILE_PATTERN_meta-ti}/recipes-graphics/libgal/"
+
+         Will match anything under ``recipes-graphics/ligbal/`` directory of
+         ``meta-ti``. And::
+
+            BBMASK += "${BBFILE_PATTERN_meta-ti}/recipes-graphics/libgal"
+
+         Will match in ``meta-ti`` any file prefixed with ``libgal`` in
+         ``recipes-graphics/`` and any directory (recursively; and its
+         recipes and recipe append files regardless how they are named) prefixed
+         with ``libgal`` in ``recipes-graphics/``. That is, provided your layers
+         are available at ``/build/layers/``, it'll match::
+
+            /builds/layers/meta-ti/recipes-graphics/libgal.bb
+            /builds/layers/meta-ti/recipes-graphics/libgal_%.bbappend
+            /builds/layers/meta-ti/recipes-graphics/libgal-foo/foo.bb
+            /builds/layers/meta-ti/recipes-graphics/libgal-foo/foo/bz.bbappend
+            /builds/layers/meta-ti/recipes-graphics/libgal/bar.bb
+
+      .. note::
+
+         Because these are complete regular expressions, failing to start the
+         pattern with a ``^`` sign (which is usually the first character in
+         :term:`BBFILE_PATTERN`) means it can match *any* portion of a path.
+         Take the following as an example::
+
+            BBMASK = "recipes-graphics/libgal/"
+
+         This will match subdirectories and files in any path containing
+         ``recipes-graphics/libgal/``, meaning (considering your layers are
+         available at ``/builds/layers/``)::
+
+            /builds/layers/meta-ti/recipes-graphics/libgal/
+            /builds/layers/my-layer/foo-recipes-graphics/libgal/
+
+         will be both matched. This may be a more relaxed way of matching
+         directories, recipes and recipe append files from any third party layer
+         but is generally discouraged as it may be casting too wide of a net.
+
+      .. note::
+
+         Because these are complete regular expressions, a leading slash does
+         not mean the path is absolute. It simply forces the directory to be
+         named exactly that. Take::
+
+            BBMASK = "recipes-graphics/libgal/"
+
+         If you happen to have a directory ``foo-recipes-graphics/libgal/``, it
+         will be matched.
+
+         Leading with a slash::
+
+            BBMASK = "/recipes-graphics/libgal/"
+
+         makes sure that doesn't happen. However, this doesn't prevent matching
+         a directory ``recipes-graphics/libgal/`` from another layer.
+
+         Again, we highly recommend using :term:`BBFILE_PATTERN` in the
+         expressions to specify absolute paths specific to one layer.
