The last value set during parsing order is used as the weak default
value.

I do think you need to spell this out with an example as it isn't what
people expect.

Yes, definitely. Whilst it makes sense, people often don't expect it.

??=3D is the value given to a variable if nothing else sets it.

In the above example it is given a weak default value of "x". " y" is
then appended to the base value which would be "x" since nothing else
sets it. Again, it does make sense we need to have examples in the
manual to make it clear.
