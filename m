Hi Aryaman,

Many thanks for the patch! Apologies for the late review, I was away on 
vacation.

See my comments below:

Actually, here you can just use "as::" instead of "as:" followed by "::" 
in the next line.

I'm afraid you'll have to add this reference in a later commit, because 
for the moment, this creates a warning that is turned into an error. 
Sorry, this is the pain of managing two manuals at once. You may say 
"Yocto Project Reference Manual" then.

By the way, you had an extra backquote at the end of your reference.

Would you mind sending a V3 fixing these, please? This one should be 
ready to merge.
Thanks in advance, and thank you for your patience :)

Cheers
Michael.
