And so the documentation would advise to always use `inherit_defer` for
conditional inherits. As far as I understand the purpose of inherit_defer, =
this
is fine to me (and error-safe), so I agree with you on removing the conditi=
onal
case from the inherit directive section and redirecting towards inherit_def=
er.

This makes me wonder why inherit_defer isn't merged into inherit then (i.e.
inherit would behave like inherit_defer by default). But I guess there are =
other
stakes that go beyond my knowledge on this. :)

Cheers,
Antonin
