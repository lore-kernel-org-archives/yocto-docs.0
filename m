  i've actually been pondering this for a while -- the best way to
keep the variables glossary up to date, and here's a thought.

  if one notices a single variable missing, and one has time and the
know-how to add that entry to the variables glossary, then submit a
patch (as i've done recently, all of which i apparently have to
improve. :-)

  on the other hand, if one finds a number of closely-related
variables that are all missing -- for which it would make little sense
to add just one or two without adding all the rest -- and one is
lacking either the time or the expertise to submit an all-encompassing
patch to add them all, then submit a bugzilla entry for it:

https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Reference

and perhaps the person or people with the know-how can handle it. at
the very least, we'd have a list of what's missing.

  i might even add a new product category entry just for this:
"variables glossary". anyway, i think this would be useful just to
keep track of what's not there, and allow people to cherry-pick what
they'd like to work on.
