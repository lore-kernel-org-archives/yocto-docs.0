+``devtool ide-sdk`` configures IDEs for the extensible SDK
+----------------------------------------------------------
+
+``devtool ide-sdk`` automatically configures IDEs to use the extensible SDK.
+To make sure that all parts of the extensible SDK required by the generated IDE configuration are
+available, ``devtool ide-sdk`` uses bitbake in the background to bootstrap the extensible SDK.
+
+The extensible SDK supports two different development modes.
+``devtool ide-sdk`` supports both of them:
+
+#. *Modified mode*:
+
+   By default ``devtool ide-sdk`` generates IDE configurations for recipes in workspaces
+   created by ``devtool modify`` or ``devtool add`` as described in :ref:`using_devtool`.
+   This mode creates IDE configurations with support for advanced features, such as deploying
+   the binaries to the remote target device and performing remote debugging sessions.
+   The generated IDE configurations use the per recipe sysroots as Bitbake does internally.
+
+   In order to use the tool, a few settings must be made.
+   As a starting example, the following lines of code can be added to the ``local.conf`` file::
+
+      # Build the companion debug file system
+      IMAGE_GEN_DEBUGFS = "1"
+      # Optimize build time: with devtool ide-sdk the dbg tar is not needed
+      IMAGE_FSTYPES_DEBUGFS = ""
+      # Without copying the binaries into roofs-dbg, GDB does not find all source files.
+      IMAGE_CLASSES += "image-combined-dbg"
+
+      # ssh is mandatory, no password simplifies the usage
+      EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "\
+         ssh-server-openssh \
+         debug-tweaks \
+      "
+
+      # Remote debugging needs the gdbserver on the target device
+      IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " gdbserver"
+
+      # Add the recipes which should be modified to the image
+      # Otherwise some dependencies might be missing.
+      IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " my-recipe"
+
+   Assuming the bitbake environment is set up correctly and a workspace has been created
+   for the recipe using ``devtool modify my-recipe``, the following command can create the
+   SDK and the configuration for VSCode in the recipe workspace::
+
+      $ devtool ide-sdk my-recipe core-image-minimal --target root@192.168.7.2
+
+   The command requires an image recipe (``core-image-minimal`` for this example)
+   that is used to create the SDK.
+   This firmware image should also be installed on the target device.
+   It is possible to pass multiple package recipes.
+   ``devtool ide-sdk`` tries to create an IDE configuration for all package recipes.
+
+   Exactly what this command does depends on the recipe respectively on the build tool used by
+   the recipe. The basic idea is to configure the IDE so that it calls the build tool exactly
+   as ``bitbake`` does.
+
+   For example, a CMake preset is created for a recipe that inherits :ref:`ref-classes-cmake`.
+   In the case of VSCode, CMake presets are supported by the CMake Tools plugin.
+   This is an example of how the build configuration used by ``bitbake`` is exported to an IDE
+   configuration that gives exactly the same build results.
+
+   Support for remote debugging with seamless integration into the IDE is important for a cross-SDK.
+   ``devtool ide-sdk`` automatically generates the necessary helper scripts for deploying the compiled
+   artifacts to the target device as well as the necessary configuration for the debugger and the IDE.
+
+   .. note::
+
+      To ensure that the debug symbols on the build machine match the binaries running on the target device,
+      it is essential that the image built by ``devtool ide-sdk`` is running on the target device.
+
+   ``devtool ide-sdk`` aims to support multiple programming languages and multiple IDEs natively.
+   Native means that the IDE is configured to call the build tool (e.g. CMake or Meson) directly.
+   This has several advantages. First of all, it is much faster than ``devtool build``.
+   But it also allows to use the very good integration of tools like CMake or GDB directly with VSCode or other IDEs.
+   However, supporting many programming languages and multiple IDEs is quite an elaborate and constantly evolving thing.
+   Support for IDEs is therefore implemented as plugins.
+   Plugins can also be provided by optional layers.
+
+   The default IDE is VSCode. Some hints about using VSCode:
+
+   - To work on the source code of a recipe an instance of VSCode is started in the recipe's workspace.
+     Example::
+
+        code build/workspace/sources/my-recipe
+
+   - To work with CMake press ``Ctrl + Shift + p``, type ``cmake``.
+     This will show some possible commands like selecting a CMake preset, compiling or running CTest.
+
+     For recipes inheriting :ref:`ref-classes-cmake-qemu` rather than :ref:`ref-classes-cmake` executing
+     cross-compiled unit tests on the host can be supported transparently with QEMU user-mode.
+
+   - To work with Meson press ``Ctrl + Shift + p``, type ``meson``.
+     This will show some possible commands like compiling or executing the unit tests.
+
+     A note on running cross-compiled unit tests on the host: Meson enables support for QEMU user-mode by default.
+     It is expected that the execution of the unit tests from the IDE will work easily without any additional steps,
+     provided that the code is suitable for execution on the host machine.
+
+   - For the deployment to the target device, just press ``Ctrl + Shift + p``, type ``task``.
+     Select the ``install && deploy-target``.
+
+   - For remote debugging, switch to the debugging view by pressing the "play" button with the ``bug icon`` on the left side.
+     This will provide a green play button with a drop-down list where a debug configuration can be selected.
+     After selecting one of the generated configurations, press the "play" button.
+
+     Starting a remote debugging session automatically initiates the deployment to the target device.
+     If this is not desired, the ``"dependsOn": ["install && deploy-target...]`` parameter of the tasks
+     with ``"label": "gdbserver start...`` can be removed from the ``tasks.json`` file.
+
+     VSCode supports GDB with many different setups and configurations for many different use cases.
+     However, most of these setups have some limitations when it comes to cross-development, support only a few target
+     architectures or require a high performance target device.
+     Therefore ``devtool ide-sdk`` supports the classic, generic setup with GDB on the development host and gdbserver
+     on the target device.
+     Roughly summarized, this means:
+
+     - The binaries are copied via ssh to the remote target device by a script referred by ``tasks.json``.
+     - gdbserver is started on the remote target device via ssh by a script referred by ``tasks.json``.
+
+       Changing the parameters that are passed to the debugging executable requires changing the generated script.
+       The scipts is located at ``oe-scripts/gdbserver_*``.
+       The definition of the parameters in the ``args`` field in the ``launch.json`` file does not work.
+
+     - VSCode connects to the gdbserver as documented in
+       `Remote debugging or debugging with a local debugger server <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/launch-json-reference#_remote-debugging-or-debugging-with-a-local-debugger-server>`__.
+
+   Additionally ``--ide=none`` is supported.
+   With the none IDE parameter some generic configurations files like ``gdbinit`` files and some helper scripts
+   starting the gdbserver remotely on the target device as well as the gdb client on the host are generated.
+
+   Usage example for the cmake-example recipe from the meta-selftest layer
+   which inherits :ref:`ref-classes-cmake-qemu`:
+
+   .. code-block:: sh
+
+      # Create the SDK
+      devtool modify cmake-example
+      devtool ide-sdk cmake-example core-image-minimal -c --debug-build-config --ide=none
+
+      # Install the firmware on a target device or start QEMU
+      runqemu
+
+      # From a Navigate into the workspace of cmake-example
+      cd build/workspace/sources/cmake-example
+
+      # Find cmake-native and save the path into a variable
+      # Note: using just cmake instead of $CMAKE_NATIVE would work in many cases
+      CMAKE_NATIVE="$(jq -r '.configurePresets[0] | "\(.cmakeExecutable)"' CMakeUserPresets.json)"

+
+#. *Shared sysroots mode*
+
+   For some recipes and use cases a per-recipe sysroot based SDK is not suitable.
+   Optionally ``devtool ide-sdk`` configures the IDE to use the tool-chain provided by the
+   extensible SDK as described in :ref:`running_the_ext_sdk_env`.
+   ``devtool ide-sdk --mode=shared`` is basically a wrapper for the setup of the extensible SDK
+   as described in :ref:`setting_up_ext_sdk_in_build`.
+   The IDE gets configuration to use the shared sysroots.
+
+   Creating a SDK with shared sysroots that contains all the dependencies needed to work with my-recipe is possible
+   with the following example command::
+
+      $ devtool ide-sdk --mode=shared my-recipe
+
+   For VSCode the cross-tool-chain is exposed as a CMake kit. CMake kits are defined in
+   ``~/.local/share/CMakeTools/cmake-tools-kits.json``.
+   The following example shows how the cross-toolchain can be selected in VSCode.
+   Fist of all we need a folder containing a CMake project.
+   For this example lets create a CMake project and start VSCode::
+
+      mkdir kit-test
+      echo "project(foo VERSION 1.0)" > kit-test/CMakeLists.txt
+      code kit-test
+
+   If there is a CMake project in the workspace cross-compilation is supported:
+
+   - Press ``Ctrl + Shift + P``, type ``CMake: Scan for Kits``
+   - Press ``Ctrl + Shift + P``, type ``CMake: Select a Kit``
+
+   Finally most of the features provided by CMake and the IDE should be available.
+
+   Other IDEs than VSCode are supported as well.
+   However, ``devtool ide-sdk --mode=shared --ide=none my-recipe`` is currently just a simple wrapper
+   for the setup of the extensible SDK as described in :ref:`setting_up_ext_sdk_in_build`.
+
 Use ``devtool upgrade`` to Create a Version of the Recipe that Supports a Newer Version of the Software
