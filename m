+
+gcc 8.0 is now the minumum required GNU C compiler version
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+This version, released in 2018, is a minimum requirement
+to build the ``mesa-native`` recipe.
+
+.. _migration-4.2-new-nvd-api:
+
+Fetching the NVD vulnerability database through the 2.0 API
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+This new version adds a new fetcher for the NVD database using the 2.0 API,
+as the 1.0 API will be retired in 2023.
+
+The implementation changes as little as possible, keeping the current
+database format (but using a different database file for the transition
+period), with a notable exception of not using the META table.
+
+Here are minor changes that you may notice:
+
+-  The database starts in 1999 instead of 2002
+-  The complete fetch is longer (30 minutes typically)
+
+.. _migration-4.2-rust-crate-checksums:
+
+Rust: mandatory checksums for crates
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+This release now supports checksums for Rust crates and make
+them mandatory for each crate in a recipe. See :yocto_git:`python3_bcrypt recipe changes
+</poky/commit/?h=mickledore&id=0dcb5ab3462fdaaf1646b05a00c7150eea711a9a>`
+for example.
+
+The ``cargo-update-recipe-crates`` utility
+:yocto_git:`has been extended </poky/commit/?h=mickledore&id=eef7fbea2c5bf59369390be4d5efa915591b7b22>`
+to include such checksums. So, in case you need to add the list of checksums
+to a recipe just inheriting the :ref:`ref-classes-cargo` class so far, you can
+follow these steps:
+
+#.  Make the recipe inherit :ref:`ref-classes-cargo-update-recipe-crates`
+#.  Remove all ``crate://`` lines from the recipe
+#.  Create an empty ``${BPN}-crates.inc`` file and make your recipe require it
+#.  Execute ``bitbake -c update_crates your_recipe``
+#.  Copy and paste the output of BitBake about the missing checksums into the
+    ``${BPN}-crates.inc`` file.

+
+-  BitBake has seen multiple internal changes that may impact
+   memory and disk usage as well as parsing time, in particular:
+
+   -  BitBake's Cooker server is now multithreaded.
+
+   -  BitBake's cache has been extended to include more hash
+      debugging data, but has also been optimized to :yocto_git:`compress
+      cache data <https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/?h=mickledore&id=7d010055e2af3294e17db862f42664ca689a9356>`.
+
+   -  BitBake's Cooker server :yocto_git:`can now be pinged
+      https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/?h=mickledore&id=26f255da09>`
+      from the UI.
 
 -  Architecture-specific enhancements:
 
+   -  This release adds initial support for the
+      :wikipedia:`LoongArch <Loongson#LoongArch>`
+      (``loongarch64``) architecture, though there is no testing for it yet.
+
 -  Kernel-related enhancements:
 
 -  QEMU/runqemu enhancements:
 
 -  Image-related enhancements:
 
+-  New variables:
+
+   - :term:`VOLATILE_TMP_DIR` allows to specify
+     whether ``/tmp`` should be on persistent storage
+     or in RAM.
+
+-  Rust improvements:
+
+   -  This release adds Cargo support on the target, and includes
+      automated QA tests for this functionality.
+
+   -  It also supports checksums for Rust crates and makes
+      them mandatory for each crate in a recipe.
+
+-  Testing:
+
+   -  The ptest images have changed structure in this release. The
+      underlying ``core-image-ptest`` recipe now uses :term:`BBCLASSEXTEND` to
+      create a variant for each ptest enabled recipe in OE-Core. 
+
+      For example, this means that ``core-image-ptest-bzip2``,
+      ``core-image-ptest-lttng-tools`` and many more image targets now exist
+      and can be built/tested individually. 
+
+      The ``core-image-ptest-all`` and ``core-image-ptest-fast`` targets are now
+      wrappers that target groups of individual images and means that the tests
+      can be executed in parallel during our automated testing. This also means
+      the dependencies are more accurately tested.
+
+   -  It is now possible to track regression changes between releases using
+      :oe_git:`yocto_testresults_query.py </openembedded-core/tree/scripts/yocto_testresults_query.py>`,
+      which is a thin wrapper over :oe_git:`resulttool
+      </openembedded-core/tree/scripts/resulttool>`. Here is an example
+      command, which allowed to spot and fix a regression in the
+      ``quilt`` ptest::
+
+         yocto_testresults_query.py regression-report 4.2_M1 4.2_M2
+
+      See this `blog post about regression detection
+      <https://bootlin.com/blog/continuous-integration-in-yocto-improving-the-regressions-detection/>`__.
+
+   -  This release adds support for parallel ptest execution with a ptest per image.
+      This takes ptest execution time from 3.5 hours to around 45 minutes on the autobuilder.
+
+-  Miscellaneous changes:
+
+   -  Supporting 64 bit dates on 32 bit platforms: several packages have been
+      updated to pass Y2038 tests.
+
+   -  Many packages were updated to add large file support.
