  having perused the SDK manual and nitpicked here and there (and
submitted some patches, hi, michael!), it's not clear to me how one
simply *uses* a pre-built SDK to speed up subsequent builds of
compatible projects.

  if i'm focused on building for a particular target, i recall from
way back there was an option to identify an external toolchain to use
to speed things. i'm *assuming* you can do the same by building,
installing and sourcing an SDK, but the SDK manual doesn't seem to
explain how to do something that basic.

  am i missing something? if i go to the trouble of building and
installing a standard SDK, how can i use it to speed up subsequent
builds?
