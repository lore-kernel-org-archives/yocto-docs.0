Hi Quentin,

Many thanks for the review!

Much better, adopted!

Oops yes, otherwise the rendering is different.

Yes, that's the server proposed in Poky's
meta-poky/conf/local.conf.sample file, though it is commented out by
default.
We talked about that in a meeting, and if I recall correctly, we agreed
to document its usage, but not turn it on by default. Effectively, if
everyone starts using it at the same time, runs could become slower than
if the corresponding artifacts were built locally.

There's a proper warning in my patch, anyway.

Don't hesitate to disagree, that's not too late!

Thanks again
Michael.
