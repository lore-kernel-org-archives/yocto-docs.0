There isn't any feedback there saying dladdr is rejected, just that
they're not sure about the general use case. Getting changes accepted
by upstreams does usually require a bit of work so I'd not quite give
up yet! I can understand it from the maintainers side too, if you're
being asked to accept and maintain something, you do need there to be a
compelling reason for it.

I didn't look in detail but at least the injected code blocks do look
relatively self contained which does make maintenance easier. The fact
they're had rebase conflicts already is sad/worrying though :(.

I'm not sure I'd hold python3native as a good example. It was what we
needed to do to get things to work and was the least worst thing :/.
Limitations to a single scripting language are much easier than a
general elf shared library.
