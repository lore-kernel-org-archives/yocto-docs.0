From: Quentin Schulz <quentin.schulz@cherry.de>

b4[1] is a very nice tool for mail-based contribution. A config[2] file
exists to set up a few defaults. We can use it to set the Cc recipients
to always add, in our case the mailing list.

This also adds a wrapper script that is called by b4 to figure out which
addresses to put as Cc recipients. Considering that patches to the doc/
directory also need to be sent to the yocto-docs mailing list, this
wrapper handles that. A limitation of the script (lsdiff actually) is
that it doesn't know how to handle empty files, but those should be
of rather rare occurrences.

While the wrapper script should be enough by itself to add the bitbake
mailing list to the Cc recipients, one still needs to manually run b4
prep --auto-to-cc for that to happen. Therefore, let's add an explicit
send-series-cc so that at least that mailing list is always there.

Because we currently do not have anything to check for patch validity,
remove requirement for b4 prep --check to be run before sending a patch
series, via disable-needs-checking in prep-pre-flight-checks.

This adds a basic config file for b4 to avoid to have to add the mailing
list by hand.
For documentation patches, the additional mailing list will be added
when running b4 prep --check, as is required for each new series managed
by b4.

Note that b4 supports patchwork, c.f.
https://b4.docs.kernel.org/en/latest/config.html#patchwork-integration-settings
though I have no clue what it does with it as I am no maintainer, but
maybe something worth having a look at if some maintainer of this repo
wants to use b4 to merge stuff?

Changes in v2:
- add b4-wrapper for auto-detecting patches that are to be sent to the
  docs mailing list as well,
- disable forced b4 prep --check for each b4-managed series,
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240524-b4-support-v1-1-0c4334c36cc7@cherry.de
