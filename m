Greetings,

Thank you all for your replies and comments!

Richard, would you accept it if I sent a patch replacing 
"BACKFILL_CONSIDERED" by "BACKFILL_EXCLUDED" in the two variables?

Of course, I can understand if that's too late for the next release, and 
instead document this oddity, at least before we can make a change again.

Good question. Maybe because ":remove" is final, and cannot be 
overridden, if I understood correctly?

Cheers
Michael.
