The current documentation is lacking details on the different kinds of
directories for putting classes as well as the order in which BitBake
includes files (classes or include files).

This patch does the following changes:

- Mention the missing classes-recipe and classes-global when applicable.
- Add a Class Types section detailed the three different directories for
  putting classes.
- Move the existing section on locating classes/include files below the
  documentation on the different directives (include/require/inherit).
- Extend the documentation on locating files with include/require and
  inherit to give proper examples, hopefully demystifying this
  mechanism a bit.

+BitBake supports class files installed in three different directories:

+-  ``classes-global/``: these classes must be inherited globally through the

+   <bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual-intro:Configuration Files>`.  These

+   the global class named ``myclass`` like so::
+
+      INHERIT += "myclass"
+
+-  ``classes-recipe/``: these classes must be inherited from a recipe using the
+   :ref:`inherit <ref-bitbake-user-manual-metadata-inherit>` directive. They do
+   not support being inherited globally. For example, you would use the recipe
+   class named ``myclass`` like so::
+
+      inherit myclass
 
-   While BitBake comes with just the one ``base.bbclass`` file in the
-   ``classes`` directory, it supports class files also being installed
-   in related directories ``classes-global`` and ``classes-recipe`` and
-   will automatically search all three directories for a selected class
-   file.
+-  ``classes/``: this final directory is meant for classes that can be used in
+   the two contexts explain above. In other words, they can be inherit either
+   globally or in a recipe.
 
-   This means that, in this documentation, when you see a reference to
-   class files being in the ``classes`` directory, you can interpret that
-   as meaning in any one of the above three directories.
+For details on how BitBake locates class files, see the
+:ref:`bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual-metadata:Locating Class Files`

+Locating Include Files
+----------------------
+
+BitBake uses the :term:`BBPATH` variable to locate needed include files.
+Additionally, BitBake searches the current directory for :ref:`include
+<ref-include-directive>` and :ref:`require <require-inclusion>` directives.
+
+.. note::
+
+   The BBPATH variable is analogous to the environment variable PATH .
+
+For these two directives, BitBake includes the first file it finds.
+
+.. note::
+
+   It is also possible to include *all* occurences of a file with the same name
+   with the :ref:`include_all <ref-include-all-directive>` directive.
+
+Let's consider the following statement called from a recipe file located in
+``/layers/meta-custom2/recipes-example/example_0.1.bb``::
+
+   require myfile.inc
+
+Where ``myfile.inc`` is located in ``/layers/meta-custom2/recipes-example/``.
+
+And let's assume that the value of :term:`BBPATH` is
+``/layers/meta-custom1:/layers/meta-custom2``. Then BitBake will try to find
+``myfile.inc`` in this order::
+
+   /layers/meta-custom2/recipes-example/example/myfile.inc
+   /layers/meta-custom1/myfile.inc
+   /layers/meta-custom2/myfile.inc
+
+In this case the first path of the list matches and BitBake includes this file
+in ``example_0.1.bb``.
+
+Another common example would be::
+
+   require recipes-other/other/otherfile.inc
+
+Where ``otherfile.inc`` is located in
+``/layers/meta-custom1/recipes-other/other/``.
+
+In this case, the following paths would be searched::
+
+   /layers/meta-custom2/recipes-example/example/recipes-other/other/otherfile.inc
+   /layers/meta-custom1/recipes-other/other/otherfile.inc
+   /layers/meta-custom2/recipes-other/other/otherfile.inc
+
+This time, the second item of this list would be matched.
+
+.. note::
+
+   In the above examples, the exact same search order applies for the
+   :ref:`include <ref-include-directive>` directive.
+
+Locating Class Files
+--------------------
+
+Like include files, class files are located using the :term:`BBPATH` variable.
+The classes can be included in the ``classes-recipe``, ``classes-global`` and
+``classes`` directories, as explained in the
+:ref:`bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual-intro:Class types` section of the
+Bitbake User Manual. Like for the :ref:`include <ref-include-directive>` and
+:ref:`require <require-inclusion>` directives, BitBake stops and inherits the
+first class that it finds.
+
+For classes inherited with the :ref:`inherit
+<ref-bitbake-user-manual-metadata-inherit>` directive, BitBake will try to
+locate the class under each ``classes-recipe`` directory for each path in
+:term:`BBPATH`, and then do the same for each ``classes`` directory for each
+path in :term:`BBPATH`.
+
+For example, if the value :term:`BBPATH` is
+``/layers/meta-custom1:/layers/meta-custom2`` then the ``hello`` class
+would be searched in this order::
+
+   /layers/meta-custom1/classes-recipe/hello.bbclass
+   /layers/meta-custom2/classes-recipe/hello.bbclass
+   /layers/meta-custom1/classes/hello.bbclass
+   /layers/meta-custom2/classes/hello.bbclass
+
+.. note::
+
+   Note that the order of the list above does not depend on where the class in
+   inherited from.
+
+Likewise, for classes inherited with the :term:`INHERIT` variable, the
+``classes-global`` directory is searched first, and the ``classes`` directory is
+searched second. Taking the above example, this would result in the following
+list::
+
+   /layers/meta-custom1/classes-global/hello.bbclass
+   /layers/meta-custom2/classes-global/hello.bbclass
+   /layers/meta-custom1/classes/hello.bbclass
+   /layers/meta-custom2/classes/hello.bbclass
+
