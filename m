BitBake snippets here render as unhighlighted text. A reStructuredText
literal block carries no language, and Sphinx falls back to a default
that cannot recognise BitBake metadata.

Pygments 2.21 added a BitBake lexer, so tag these 95 blocks
explicitly. Variable names, assignment operators, override chains,
expansions and shell or Python task bodies are then highlighted.

The syntax chapter is where the language itself is described, so almost
every example in it is BitBake.
